    "# **UNIT 3: NETWORK CONSTRUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Connection:**\n",
    "It is the link that allows computers and devices to communicate and share data or resources over a network, either through cables (wired) or radio signals (wireless).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Link Aggregation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Link Aggregation is the technique of combining multiple physical network links into one logical link to **increase bandwidth** and provide **redundancy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Also known as **Port Trunking** or **EtherChannel**.\n",
    "* Uses **IEEE 802.3ad (LACP – Link Aggregation Control Protocol)**.\n",
    "* If one link fails, traffic automatically switches to remaining links.\n",
    "* Works between **switches, routers, or servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Higher throughput:** Combines multiple links’ speeds.\n",
    "* **Load balancing:** Distributes traffic evenly.\n",
    "* **Redundancy:** Prevents network downtime if one link fails.\n",
    "* **Scalability:** Easy to expand by adding more links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "If each link has 1 Gbps capacity and 4 links are aggregated, total bandwidth = **4 Gbps**.\n",

    "## **2. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) Principles**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **VLAN** is a logical network created within a physical network to **segment devices** for security, efficiency, or management reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* VLANs are defined by **IEEE 802.1Q** standard.\n",
    "* Each VLAN acts as a **separate broadcast domain**.\n",
    "* VLANs are identified by a **VLAN ID (1–4094)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of VLAN**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Default VLAN** – VLAN 1 on most switches; all ports belong to it initially.\n",
    "2. **Data VLAN** – Carries user-generated traffic.\n",
    "3. **Voice VLAN** – Dedicated to VoIP traffic.\n",
    "4. **Management VLAN** – Used for switch management.\n",
    "5. **Native VLAN** – Handles untagged traffic on trunk ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Better **security** and **traffic control**.\n",
    "* Reduces **broadcast traffic**.\n",
    "* Simplifies **network management**.\n",
    "* Allows **logical grouping** of users even if they are not physically close.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. GARP (Generic Attribute Registration Protocol)** and **GVRP (GARP VLAN Registration Protocol)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GARP**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A protocol for **registering and deregistering attributes (like VLANs)** on network switches.\n",
    "* Ensures consistent VLAN information across all devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **GVRP**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built on top of GARP, defined by **IEEE 802.1Q**.\n",
    "* Automatically **registers VLAN membership** on trunk links.\n",
    "* Simplifies VLAN management in large networks by **automating propagation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When a switch port joins a VLAN, it sends a **Join message**.\n",
    "* Other switches learn this and add that VLAN to their ports automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. VLAN Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Need**\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate directly because VLANs are separate broadcast domains.\n",
    "**Routing** is required for inter-VLAN communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Router-on-a-Stick**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses one physical router interface with **sub-interfaces**, each assigned to a VLAN.\n",
    "* Cost-effective for small networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Layer 3 Switch**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performs routing directly at the switch level using **SVIs (Switch Virtual Interfaces)**.\n",
    "* Faster than routers as switching is done in hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "* VLAN 10: 192.168.1.0/24\n",
    "* VLAN 20: 192.168.2.0/24\n",
    "* Router or L3 switch routes traffic between them.\n",
