    "# **UNIT 4: NETWORK SECURITY**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network Security:**\n",
    "It is the practice of protecting a network and its data from unauthorized access, misuse, or attacks using tools like firewalls, encryption, and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Firewall**\n",
    "\n",
    "A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls data entering or leaving a network.\n",
    "It acts like a gatekeeper that blocks harmful traffic and allows only safe and approved communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Encryption**\n",
    "\n",
    "Encryption is a method of protecting data by converting it into a coded format.\n",
    "Only the person who has the correct key can decode and read the original information, ensuring privacy during storage or transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device.\n",
    "It ensures that only authorized people can access the network, usually through passwords, OTP, biometrics, or security tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Access Control Lists (ACLs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Access Control List (ACL)** is a set of rules that control **network traffic flow** and help **secure networks** by permitting or denying packets based on conditions like IP address, protocol, or port.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To **filter traffic** entering or leaving a network.\n",
    "* To **control access** to network resources.\n",
    "* To **enhance network security** by blocking unauthorized users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Where ACLs Are Applied**\n",
    "\n",
    "* On **routers** or **firewalls**.\n",
    "* Can be applied on **inbound** or **outbound** interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of ACL**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard ACL**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Filters traffic **based on source IP address only**.  \n",
    "   * Syntax:  \n",
    "     `access-list <number> permit|deny <source> <wildcard-mask>`   \n",
    "     Example:  \n",
    "     `access-list 10 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extended ACL**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Filters traffic based on **source & destination IP**, **protocol**, and **port number**.\n",
    "   * Syntax:  \n",
    "     `access-list <number> permit|deny <protocol> <source> <wildcard> <destination> <wildcard> [eq <port>]`  \n",
    "   * Example:  \n",
    "     `access-list 110 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 80`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Named ACL**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses a **custom name** instead of a number for easier management.  \n",
    "     Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ip access-list extended WebAccess\n",
    "     permit tcp any any eq 80\n",
    "     deny ip any any\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ACL Placement**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Standard ACL**: Placed **close to the destination** (to avoid blocking too much traffic).\n",
    "* **Extended ACL**: Placed **close to the source** (to stop unwanted traffic early).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Wildcard Mask**\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to match IP ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `0` = exact match\n",
    "* `1` = ignore\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "`192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255` matches all IPs from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improves **network security**.\n",
    "* Controls **traffic flow** efficiently.\n",
    "* Helps in **troubleshooting** and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "AAA is a **security framework** that controls who can access the network, what they can do, and keeps records of their activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Authentication**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Verifies the **identity** of a user or device before allowing access.\n",
    "* Common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Password-based**\n",
    "  * **Token-based**\n",
    "  * **Biometric**\n",
    "  * **Two-factor authentication**\n",
    "* Example: Logging into a network using a username and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Authorization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determines **what actions or resources** a user is allowed to access after authentication.\n",
    "* Example: An admin user can configure routers, while a guest can only browse the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Accounting**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keeps a **record of user activity**: login time, duration, commands used, data transferred.\n",
    "* Used for **monitoring, auditing, and billing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AAA Protocols**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses **UDP (ports 1812/1813)**.\n",
    "   * Combines authentication and authorization in one process.\n",
    "   * Widely used for **Wi-Fi** and **remote access servers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses **TCP (port 49)**.\n",
    "   * Separates authentication, authorization, and accounting.\n",
    "   * Preferred in **enterprise and Cisco networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of AAA**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Centralized user control.\n",
    "* Strong authentication and logging.\n",
    "* Flexible management of user privileges.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why AAA is important**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protects a network from unauthorized access and misuse.\n",
    "* Ensures users get only the level of access they need — nothing more.\n",
    "* Helps track user actions to detect misuse or troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Where AAA is used**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corporate networks and data centers.\n",
    "* Cloud platforms.\n",
    "* VPN and remote access systems.\n",
    "* Wi-Fi authentication in colleges, offices, and hotels.\n",
    "* Network devices like routers, firewalls, and switches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How AAA works (flow at a glance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User tries to access the network.\n",
    "2. **Authentication** confirms identity.\n",
    "3. **Authorization** assigns allowed permissions.\n",
    "4. **Accounting** logs the activity for records.\n",
