    "### 1. **Establishing a Single Switched Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** A switched network uses **switches** to connect devices in a LAN.\n",
    "* **Why switches (instead of hubs)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Switches send data only to the **intended device** (unicast), while hubs broadcast to all.\n",
    "* **Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Devices connect to switch ports.\n",
    "  2. Switch learns **MAC addresses** and stores them in a MAC table.\n",
    "  3. Data is forwarded only to the correct device.\n",
    "* **Advantages:** Efficient, secure, reduces collisions, increases bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 *Diagram:*\n",

    "### 2. **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem in large networks:** Redundant links can create **loops**, causing broadcast storms.\n",
    "* **STP Solution:** Blocks some links to prevent loops, but keeps them as **backup paths**.\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Selects a **Root Bridge** (main switch).\n",
    "  * Decides which links should forward/block traffic.\n",
    "  * Ensures **only one active path** between any two devices.\n",
    "* **Downside:** Convergence (time to rebuild paths) is slow (30-50 seconds).\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Faster convergence (5-10 seconds).\n",

    "  * **Subnetting:** Dividing IP addresses into smaller subnets.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** One of the oldest **dynamic routing protocols**.\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Routers exchange routing tables with neighbors every 30 sec.\n",

    "* **Advantages:** Easy to configure.\n",
    "* **Disadvantages:**\n",

    "\n",
    "* **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** A modern dynamic routing protocol.\n",
    "* **Type:** Link-state protocol (unlike RIP which is distance-vector).\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Each router shares its **link state information** with all others in its area.\n",
    "  2. All routers build the same **link-state database**.\n",
    "  3. Uses **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to calculate shortest path.\n",
    "* **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Fast convergence.\n",
    "  * Scalable (works well in large networks).\n",
    "  * Supports **VLSM & CIDR** (classless).\n",
    "* **Disadvantage:** More complex to configure than RIP.\n",
    "\n",
