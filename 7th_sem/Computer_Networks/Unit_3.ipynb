    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌐 **1. Definition of Network Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Network Layer** is the **3rd layer** in the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model**.\n",
    "* It is responsible for **delivery of packets from the source host to the destination host across multiple networks**.\n",
    "* It provides **logical addressing, routing, and switching** to ensure that data travels efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Think of it as the **postal service** of the Internet:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data = Letters 📩\n",
    "* Logical Address (IP Address) = Destination Address 🏠\n",
    "* Routers = Post offices that decide the path 🛣️\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ **2. Functions of Network Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logical Addressing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Adds an **IP address** (IPv4 or IPv6) to identify each device uniquely.\n",
    "   * Ensures **host-to-host delivery**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Routing**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Finds the **best path** for packet delivery using routing algorithms (e.g., OSPF, RIP, BGP).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Packet Forwarding**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Routers read the **destination address** in the packet header and forward it to the next hop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Switching**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses **switching techniques** (circuit, packet, message) for data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fragmentation & Reassembly**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Breaks large packets into smaller fragments if the data exceeds the **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**.\n",
    "   * Reassembles them at the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling & Congestion Control**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Uses protocols like **ICMP** for error reporting.\n",
    "   * Manages **traffic congestion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 **3. Switching Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching = the **method of transferring data** from sender to receiver through the network.\n",
    "There are **three main types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 **Circuit Switching**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **dedicated communication path** is established between sender and receiver before data transfer.\n",
    "* Resources remain reserved until communication ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example: **Traditional telephone networks**.  \n",
    "⚡ Pros: Reliable, fixed bandwidth.  \n",
    "❌ Cons: Wastes resources if no data is sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 **Packet Switching**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is divided into **small packets**.\n",
    "* Each packet is sent independently through the network.\n",
    "* At the destination, packets are **reassembled** in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example: **Internet (IP-based communication)**.  \n",
    "⚡ Pros: Efficient use of bandwidth, supports many users.  \n",
    "❌ Cons: Packets may arrive **out of order** or get delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Datagram Packet Switching** (packets may follow different routes).\n",
    "* **Virtual Circuit Packet Switching** (a logical path is established first).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 **Message Switching**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entire message is treated as a **single block** and transferred from node to node.\n",
    "* Each node **stores and forwards** the complete message.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Example: **Email services (old systems)**.\n",
    "⚡ Pros: No need for dedicated path.\n",
    "❌ Cons: Delay due to \"store-and-forward\".\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏷️ **4. Logical Addressing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical addressing = **assigning unique addresses** to devices in a network, so that packets can reach the correct destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.1 IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **32-bit address** → written in **dotted decimal format** (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).\n",
    "* Provides about **4.3 billion unique addresses**.\n",
    "* Header size: **20–60 bytes**.\n",
    "* Uses **NAT (Network Address Translation)** to handle shortage of addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **IPv4 Address Classes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class A**: 0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255 (Large networks)\n",
    "* **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255 (Medium networks)\n",
    "* **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255 (Small networks)\n",
    "* **Class D**: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Multicasting)\n",
    "* **Class E**: 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 (Experimental)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **IPv4 Limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limited address space.\n",
    "* Poor security (IPSec optional).\n",
    "* Manual configuration or DHCP needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **128-bit address** → written in **hexadecimal with colons** (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).\n",
    "* Provides **3.4 × 10³⁸ unique addresses** (virtually unlimited).\n",
    "* Header size: **40 bytes (fixed)** → more efficient.\n",
    "* Built-in support for **security (IPSec)**.\n",
    "* Supports **auto-configuration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Advantages of IPv6 over IPv4**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vast address space.\n",
    "* Faster routing (simplified header).\n",
    "* Eliminates NAT.\n",
    "* Better support for **IoT devices**.\n",
