    "\n",
    "## 🌐 **1. Data Link Layer (DLL) – Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **2nd layer** in the **OSI model**.\n",
    "* Responsible for **node-to-node delivery** (directly connected devices).\n",
    "* Main tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Framing** (divide data into frames).\n",
    "  2. **Error Detection & Correction** (detect/correct transmission errors).\n",
    "  3. **Flow Control & Error Control** (manage data speed & retransmission).\n",
    "  4. **Medium Access Control (MAC)** (decide who can use the channel in a shared medium).\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Think of it like the **traffic police** 🚦 ensuring smooth, error-free, and fair data transmission between adjacent nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 **2. Error Detection and Correction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors occur due to **noise, attenuation, distortion** in the transmission medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Error Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Single-bit error**: Only one bit changes (0→1 or 1→0).\n",
    "  * **Burst error**: Multiple consecutive bits change.\n",
    "* Two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Error Detection** → detect errors, request retransmission.\n",
    "  * **Error Correction** → detect + correct errors at the receiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Block Coding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Redundancy bits** are added to data bits to form a **codeword**.\n",
    "* Receiver checks codeword to detect/correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Linear Block Codes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A valid codeword follows a **mathematical rule**.\n",
    "* Invalid patterns → error detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Hamming Distance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **number of bit positions in which two codewords differ**.\n",
    "* Example: `10101` and `11110` → differ at 2 positions → Hamming Distance = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minimum Hamming Distance (dmin):**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To **detect** up to `dmin – 1` errors.\n",
    "  * To **correct** up to `⌊(dmin – 1)/2⌋` errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.4 CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **polynomial-based error detection** method.\n",
    "* Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Data is divided by a **generator polynomial (G(x))**.\n",
    "  2. **Remainder (CRC bits)** is appended to data.\n",
    "  3. Receiver divides again with same polynomial.\n",
    "  4. If remainder = 0 → no error.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Used in **Ethernet, Wi-Fi, HDLC**.\n",
    "⚡ Very powerful in detecting **burst errors**.\n",

    "## 🔄 **3. Flow Control & Error Control Protocols**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.1 Stop and Wait**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sender transmits **one frame at a time**, waits for **ACK** before sending next.\n",
    "  ✅ Simple, reliable.\n",
    "  ❌ Inefficient (channel idle during wait).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.2 Go-Back-N ARQ**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sender can send **multiple frames (window size N)** without waiting.\n",
    "* If error detected → retransmit the **error frame + all subsequent frames**.\n",
    "  ✅ Better utilization.\n",
    "  ❌ Wastes bandwidth if errors frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.3 Selective Repeat ARQ**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only the **erroneous frame** is retransmitted (not the entire sequence).\n",
    "  ✅ Efficient.\n",
    "  ❌ Complex (requires buffers at receiver).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.4 Sliding Window Protocol**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Both sender and receiver maintain a **window of frames**.\n",
    "* Allows **multiple outstanding frames** in pipeline.\n",
    "* Increases efficiency (full-duplex data flow).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3.5 Piggybacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **bidirectional communication**, ACK is not sent separately but **attached to data frames** going in reverse direction.\n",
    "  ✅ Saves bandwidth.\n",
    "  ❌ Adds delay if no data to send.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📡 **4. Medium Access Control (MAC)**\n",

    "* Efficiency: **36.8%**.\n",
    "  ✅ Reduces collisions compared to Pure ALOHA.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (c) **CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before transmitting, a station **listens to the channel**.\n",
    "* If channel is busy → wait.\n",
    "* If free → transmit.\n",
    "* Reduces collisions but not perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (d) **CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used in **Ethernet (wired LANs)**.\n",
    "* Station transmits only if medium is free.\n",
    "* If collision detected → stop transmission → send **jam signal** → retransmit after random backoff.\n",
    "  ✅ Efficient for wired networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (e) **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used in **Wi-Fi (wireless LANs)**.\n",
    "* Since collision **cannot be detected easily in wireless**, it **avoids** them using:\n",
