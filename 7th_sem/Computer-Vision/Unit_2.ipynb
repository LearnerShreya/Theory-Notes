    "     * Example: Blurring by averaging neighbor pixels.\n",
    "  2. **Frequency Domain** → Image represented by its **frequency components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Low frequency = smooth regions (slow changes).\n",
    "     * High frequency = edges, noise, fine details (rapid changes).\n",
