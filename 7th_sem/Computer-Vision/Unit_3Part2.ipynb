    "### **1. Pseudo-color Image Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:**\n",
    "Pseudo-color (false color) processing is used to assign colors to grayscale images to make visual interpretation easier. It doesn’t change the original data; it just changes how it looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To highlight details not easily visible in grayscale images.\n",
    "* Used in medical imaging, satellite images, thermal maps, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intensity Slicing (Gray Level Slicing):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Divide the range of gray levels into intervals.\n",
    "   * Assign a specific color to each interval.\n",
    "   * Example: pixel intensity 0–50 → blue, 51–150 → green, 151–255 → red.\n",
    "   * It enhances different intensity regions with distinct colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gray Level to Color Transformation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A continuous mapping function assigns a color to every gray value.\n",
    "   * Common method: use colormap functions like “Jet,” “Hot,” or “Viridis” in MATLAB/Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Medical X-ray or thermal image → colored using pseudo-color to differentiate temperature or density variations.\n",

    "**Common transformations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Transformations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each output color channel is a linear combination of input channels.\n",
    "   * Example: converting RGB → Grayscale using:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Gray = 0.2989R + 0.5870G + 0.1140B\n",
    "     $$\n",

    "2. **Color Space Conversion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * RGB ↔ HSV, RGB ↔ YCbCr, RGB ↔ Lab, etc.\n",
    "   * Used for segmentation, enhancement, or compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Histogram Equalization in Color Images:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Apply histogram equalization to intensity or luminance component (like V in HSV or Y in YCbCr).\n",
    "   * It improves contrast without distorting color balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Color Normalization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Used for color constancy (making image colors look the same under different lighting).\n",
    "   * Normalized RGB:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     r = \\frac{R}{R+G+B}, \\quad g = \\frac{G}{R+G+B}, \\quad b = \\frac{B}{R+G+B}\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "2. **Unsharp Masking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Subtract a blurred version of the image from the original to highlight edges.\n",
