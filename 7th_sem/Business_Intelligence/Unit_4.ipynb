    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CCR Model** is one of the most important models in **Efficiency Measurement** — especially in **Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)**.\n",
    "It was introduced by **Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978)**, hence the name **CCR**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model helps to **measure the relative efficiency** of similar units (like departments, branches, companies, or machines) that use **multiple inputs** to produce **multiple outputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What is Efficiency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words,\n",
    "$$\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Output}}{\\text{Input}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real-life situations, we often have **many inputs and many outputs**, so we can’t calculate it easily using just this formula.\n",
    "That’s where **DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis)** and the **CCR model** help.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What is the CCR Model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CCR model** is a **linear programming-based approach** that evaluates the **relative efficiency** of similar entities, called **Decision-Making Units (DMUs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each **DMU**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **multiple inputs** (like labor, time, cost, materials)\n",
    "* Produces **multiple outputs** (like sales, profit, services, performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model finds the **best-performing DMUs** and then **compares others** with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Objective of the CCR Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measure efficiency** of each DMU (organization, branch, machine, etc.)\n",
    "2. **Identify benchmarks** — i.e., the most efficient DMUs (called *peer groups*).\n",
    "3. **Set targets** for inefficient units to improve.\n",
    "4. **Find reasons for inefficiency** — too much input, too little output, or both.\n",
    "5. **Provide actionable recommendations** for performance improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Key Concept – Decision-Making Units (DMUs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DMU** is any unit whose efficiency you want to evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank branches\n",
    "* Hospitals\n",
    "* Schools\n",
    "* Retail stores\n",
    "* Employees\n",
    "* Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "All DMUs must:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform **similar functions**\n",
    "* Use **similar types of inputs**\n",
    "* Produce **similar types of outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. The Mathematical Idea (Conceptually)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each DMU’s **efficiency score** is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Weighted Sum of Outputs}}{\\text{Weighted Sum of Inputs}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model finds the **best possible weights** for inputs and outputs that give the DMU the highest efficiency (but without exceeding 1 for others).\n",
    "\n",
    "So,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficient DMUs have score = **1 (100%)**\n",
    "* Inefficient DMUs have score **< 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Definition of Target Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **target objectives** in the CCR model are basically the **goals or benchmarks** an inefficient DMU should achieve to become efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a DMU is not efficient (efficiency < 1), we determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much **inputs need to be reduced**, and\n",
    "* How much **outputs need to be increased**\n",
    "\n",
    "so that it reaches efficiency = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A bank branch uses 10 employees and produces 1000 transactions.\n",
    "* An efficient branch uses the same 10 employees to produce 1200 transactions.\n",
    "  So the target is to **increase output by 20%** to match efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process defines **target objectives** for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Peer Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Peer Group** (or **Reference Set**) consists of **efficient DMUs** that serve as **role models** for inefficient DMUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each inefficient DMU is compared against one or more **efficient DMUs**.\n",
    "* These efficient ones are called **peers** or **benchmarks**.\n",
    "* The model identifies **how much influence** each peer has in setting the target for the inefficient DMU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose DMU A (inefficient) has efficiency 0.8.\n",
    "* DMUs B and C are efficient.\n",
    "* The model might show that DMU A’s performance should move toward a **combination of B (70%) and C (30%)** to become efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means **B and C form the peer group** for A.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Graphical Understanding (Simple View)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a graph with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inputs on the X-axis\n",
    "* Outputs on the Y-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "All efficient DMUs lie on the **Efficiency Frontier Line (Envelope Line)**.\n",
    "All inefficient DMUs lie **below** this line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCR model helps inefficient units **move up to the frontier** by setting **targets** and identifying **peer references**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. CCR Model – Two Orientations**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main forms of the CCR model:\n",

    "# ⚙️ **Unit 4 – Part 4: Other Models (Efficiency Measures)**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the **CCR model** (Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes) and **Cross Efficiency Analysis**, there are several **other models** used to measure and improve efficiency in organizations.\n",
    "These models are mainly **extensions or variations of DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis)** that deal with **real-world challenges** like variable returns, slacks, non-radial inputs/outputs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s go through them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. BCC Model (Banker, Charnes, and Cooper Model)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **BCC model** is an extension of the **CCR model** that allows for **Variable Returns to Scale (VRS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **CCR model**, it’s assumed that outputs will increase in direct proportion to inputs (Constant Returns to Scale).\n",
    "But in real life, this is rarely true — sometimes increasing inputs doesn’t increase output equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **BCC model** relaxes that assumption and allows the relationship to vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula and Concept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* CCR model assumes:\n",
    "  $$ \\text{Output increases proportionally with Input} $$\n",
    "  (Constant Returns to Scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "* BCC model assumes:\n",
    "  $$ \\text{Output increases non-proportionally with Input} $$\n",
    "  (Variable Returns to Scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some Decision Making Units (DMUs) may operate under **increasing returns to scale (IRS)** (efficiency improves as size grows)\n",
    "* Others under **decreasing returns to scale (DRS)** (efficiency reduces as size grows)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find whether inefficiency is due to **managerial performance** or **scale of operations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we compare 10 hospitals.\n",
    "A small hospital might perform better per resource used, even if its total output is smaller — BCC helps capture that efficiency more accurately than CCR.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Additive Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Additive Model** is a **non-radial** model in DEA, meaning it looks at the **sum of input excesses and output shortfalls** rather than proportional changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Concept:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of reducing all inputs or increasing all outputs by the same ratio, this model focuses on **individual slacks** (unused inputs or missed outputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Maximize:} \\quad \\sum (\\text{Output Slacks}) + \\sum (\\text{Input Slacks}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps in identifying where exactly inefficiencies lie — which input is being wasted or which output can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a bank uses more employees (input) but processes fewer loans (output), this model shows **how much input can be reduced or how much output should increase** to reach efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Slack-Based Measure (SBM) Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Slack-Based Measure (SBM)** model directly measures efficiency by incorporating **input and output slacks** into the efficiency score.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives a **true efficiency value** between 0 and 1, considering all unused resources and missing outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Formula (Simplified):**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{Efficiency} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Average of input slacks}}{\\text{Total inputs}} - \\frac{\\text{Average of output slacks}}{\\text{Total outputs}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if slacks are large, efficiency decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* More accurate than CCR or BCC when data has slacks.\n",
    "* Suitable when efficiency cannot be captured proportionally.\n",
    "* Reflects real operational inefficiencies.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Super-Efficiency Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Super-Efficiency Model** is used to **rank efficient DMUs** that all score 1 in regular DEA models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In CCR or BCC, multiple DMUs may appear “efficient” (efficiency = 1).\n",
    "To differentiate them, the Super-Efficiency model removes the DMU under evaluation from the reference set and measures how efficient it still is compared to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Case Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If 5 factories all show efficiency = 1 under DEA, the Super-Efficiency model will show values like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Factory A = 1.20\n",
    "* Factory B = 1.10\n",
    "* Factory C = 0.98\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Window Analysis Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Window Analysis** evaluates DMUs **over time** rather than at a single point.\n",
    "\n",
    "It treats the same DMU (say, a company or department) in different time periods as **different entities** and compares their performance trends.\n",

    "This shows **improvement or decline** in efficiency over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tracks performance trends.\n",
    "* Shows which DMU is improving or declining.\n",

    "## **6. Two-Stage DEA Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, efficiency cannot be measured in a single step because output from one stage becomes **input for another stage**.\n",
    "The **Two-Stage DEA Model** handles such multi-stage processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **university**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stage 1:** Inputs (faculty, funds) produce intermediate outputs (research papers).\n",
    "* **Stage 2:** Intermediate outputs become inputs for final outputs (student placements, patents).\n",

    "\n",
    "A **Network DEA Model** analyzes systems where multiple interrelated processes exist, like a **supply chain**, **production network**, or **multi-department organization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It treats each internal process as a “node” in a network and evaluates the overall system efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "In a manufacturing company:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stage 1: Procurement\n",
    "* Stage 2: Production\n",
    "* Stage 3: Distribution\n",

    "It’s a mix of **DEA** and **Statistical Analysis**, making it more realistic for industries where data changes frequently.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Bootstrapped DEA** model applies **resampling techniques (bootstrap methods)** to correct for bias in efficiency scores and improve reliability.\n",
