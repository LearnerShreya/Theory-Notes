    "## **UNIT IV: Run-Time Environment and Code Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Run-Time Environment (RTE)** and **Code Generation** phase of a compiler deal with how programs execute in memory after compilation.\n",
    "This includes how **variables are stored, functions are called, memory is managed**, and how **machine-level instructions** are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Storage Organization**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a program runs, its memory is divided into **different sections** to store various data like code, variables, constants, and temporary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Memory Layout of a Program**\n",

    "### **Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Segment (Text Segment):**\n",
    "   Stores executable code (machine instructions).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Segment:**\n",
    "   Stores **global** and **static variables**.\n",

    "   * Uninitialized data (default to zero).\n",

    "   Used for **dynamic memory allocation** (e.g., `malloc` or `new`).\n",
    "   Grows **upward** during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stack:**\n",
    "   Used for **function calls**, **local variables**, and **return addresses**.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Stack Allocation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **stack** is one of the most common methods for managing memory during function execution.\n",
    "Each function call creates a **stack frame (activation record)** containing all information needed for that call.\n",

    "| **Actual Parameters** | Values passed to the function.                |\n",
    "| **Control Link**      | Points to the caller’s activation record.     |\n",
    "| **Access Link**       | Used to access non-local variables (if any).  |\n",

    "| **Temporaries**       | Intermediate values generated by expressions. |\n",

    "### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a recursive function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int fact(int n) {\n",
    "    if (n == 0) return 1;\n",
    "    return n * fact(n - 1);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each recursive call creates a **new activation record** in the stack for that specific call to `fact(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Access to Non-local Data on the Stack**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is **nested inside another**, it may need to access variables declared in its **outer (non-local) function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to access such variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Access Link**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each activation record stores a **pointer to the activation record of its immediately enclosing function**.\n",
    "* Used to **traverse back** to find the non-local variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Display Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintains a separate **array of pointers (display table)**, where each entry points directly to the current activation record at a given nesting level.\n",
    "* Faster than access links.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "void A() {\n",
    "    int x = 10;\n",
    "    void B() {\n",
    "        int y = x + 1;  // Non-local access to x\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `B()` accesses `x` of `A()` using **access link or display**.\n",

    "## **4. Heap Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **heap** is used for dynamic memory allocation during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Allocation:** Assigns a memory block for a variable or object.\n",
    "2. **Deallocation:** Frees the memory after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Heap Management Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Free List:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Keeps track of available memory blocks.\n",
    "   * On allocation, a suitable block is removed; on deallocation, it’s added back.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Garbage Collection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Automatic reclamation of memory that is no longer in use.\n",
    "   * Common in languages like Java and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reference Counting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each object keeps a count of references.\n",
    "   * When count reaches zero, memory is freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mark and Sweep:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Marks all reachable objects.\n",
    "   * Sweeps (deletes) unmarked ones.\n",

    "## **5. Issues in Code Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Code Generation** phase converts **intermediate code (TAC)** into **target machine code**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Main Issues**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input:**\n",
    "   The input is usually **Intermediate Code (TAC)**, **Symbol Table**, and **Type Information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Target Code Quality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Code should be **efficient** (fast execution, minimal memory).\n",
    "   * Should use **minimum registers** and **instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instruction Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Choosing the right **machine instruction** for each operation.\n",
    "   * Example: `x = y + z` → `ADD R1, R2, R3`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Register Allocation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Deciding which values are kept in **registers** and which go to **memory**.\n",
    "   * Registers are limited, so efficient usage is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Order of Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Determines the **sequence** of instructions to minimize temporary variables.\n",

    "6. **Storage Management:**\n",

    "   * Assigning locations to variables, constants, and temporaries.\n",
