    "## **UNIT III: Intermediate Code Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Intermediate Code Generation (ICG)** phase of a compiler comes **after syntax and semantic analysis** and **before code optimization and final code generation**.\n",
    "Its purpose is to translate the source program into an **intermediate representation (IR)** that is easier to analyze and optimize.\n",

    "### **1. Syntax Directed Definitions (SDD)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "A **Syntax Directed Definition** is a set of rules or semantic actions associated with a grammar.\n",
    "It specifies how to compute values (like types, intermediate code, etc.) based on the structure of the syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each grammar symbol has **attributes**.\n",
    "* Each grammar production has **semantic rules** that define how to compute these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Attributes Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Synthesized Attributes:**\n",
    "   Computed from the attribute values of the **children nodes** in the parse tree.\n",
    "   Example: `E → E1 + T`\n",
    "   → `E.val = E1.val + T.val`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inherited Attributes:**\n",
    "   Computed from the attribute values of the **parent and/or sibling nodes**.\n",
    "   Example: `T → num`\n",
    "   → `T.type = E.type`\n",

    "#### **1. S-attributed Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses only **synthesized attributes**.\n",
    "* Evaluation is done **bottom-up** (postorder traversal).\n",
    "* Commonly used in **LR parsers**.\n",

    "#### **2. L-attributed Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses both **inherited and synthesized attributes**, but with restrictions.\n",
    "* Evaluation is done **left-to-right**.\n",
    "* Commonly used in **LL parsers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Production: E → E1 + T\n",
    "Semantic rules:\n",
    "E1.inherited = E.inherited\n",

    "**Definition:**\n",
