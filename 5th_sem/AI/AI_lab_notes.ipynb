    "1. **Traversal Order**: BFS explores nodes level by level, while DFS explores nodes along one path as far as possible before backtracking.  \n",
    "2. **Data Structures**: BFS uses a **Queue** (FIFO), whereas DFS uses a **Stack** (LIFO) or recursion.  \n",
    "3. **Path Finding**: BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph, while DFS does not.  \n",
    "4. **Memory Usage**: BFS requires more memory as it stores all nodes at the current level, whereas DFS uses less memory but can go deeper.  \n",
    "5. **Use Cases**: BFS is better for shortest paths and searches on broad graphs, whereas DFS is better for puzzles, cycles, and tree traversals.  \n",

    "   - Traversal of shallow graphs.  \n",
