* You **use it only when needed**.
* You decide **when, where, and how** to use it.
* It helps in doing **specific tasks**.

* Easy to learn and flexible.

**Examples**

* Pandas (data handling)
* Matplotlib (graphs)

### Framework

* A **framework** is a complete structure for building applications.
* You must **work inside its rules**.
* It decides **how the program runs**.
* Used to build **full applications**.
* The framework controls the flow, not you.
* Learning takes more time but gives structure.

**Examples**

* Flask (web apps)
* React (frontend)
* TensorFlow (ML framework)

**Simple meaning**
