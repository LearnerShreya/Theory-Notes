    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "Unsupervised learning techniques like **K-means clustering** and **Association Rules** are powerful tools for finding patterns and relationships in data without labeled outcomes. While **K-means** is great for grouping data into clusters, **Association Rules** help in identifying relationships between variables, making them both highly valuable in various applications.\n",

    "# 🔷 **4. Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 **Definition:**\n",
    "A **Decision Tree** is a **supervised learning algorithm** that can be used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, and organizes the decisions into a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and the leaf nodes represent the final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🌳 **Structure**:\n",
    "- **Root Node**: The root node represents the entire dataset. This is where the first split of the data happens based on the best feature.\n",
    "- **Internal Nodes**: These nodes represent decisions made by evaluating one feature or condition.\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: The leaf nodes contain the final prediction. For classification tasks, this represents the predicted class, and for regression tasks, it represents the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 **Splitting Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree uses various metrics to decide the best way to split the data at each node. These criteria help determine the feature that will give the purest possible subsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gini Impurity**: Gini impurity measures the impurity or the likelihood of a wrong classification at a node.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Gini = 1 - \\sum p_i^2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $p_i$ is the probability of class $i$ in the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A Gini score of 0 indicates that all elements in the node belong to the same class, whereas a score close to 1 indicates that the node is very impure and contains a mix of different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Entropy**: Entropy measures the uncertainty or disorder within the dataset. A lower entropy indicates more homogeneous (pure) nodes.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Entropy = - \\sum p_i \\log_2(p_i)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $p_i$ is the probability of class $i$ in the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A node with entropy 0 is perfectly pure (all samples belong to one class).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Gain**: Information gain calculates the reduction in entropy after a dataset is split based on a feature. It tells us how much uncertainty is reduced by a split.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Information Gain = Entropy(Parent) - \\sum \\frac{|Subset|}{|Parent|} \\times Entropy(Subset)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The **Information Gain** is calculated for each feature and the feature with the highest gain is chosen for the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**: Suppose you want to split a dataset of customers based on their age (young, middle-aged, and old) to predict whether they will buy a product. The algorithm will calculate the **Information Gain** for each feature (age, income, etc.) and choose the feature with the highest gain to split the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 **Tree Example:**\n",
    "Consider a dataset with the following features:\n",
    "- **Age** (Young, Middle-aged, Old)\n",
    "- **Income** (Low, High)\n",
    "- **Buy Product** (Yes, No)\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree might split the data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root Node**: Age\n",
    "   - **Young** → Go to \"Low Income\"\n",
    "   - **Middle-aged** → Go to \"High Income\"\n",
    "2. **Leaf Node**: \"Buy Product\"\n",

    "- If the customer is **young** and has **low income**, they are unlikely to buy the product.\n",

    "---\n",

    "#### ✅ **Pros**:\n",
    "- **Easy to interpret and visualize**: The tree-like structure is intuitive and easy to understand.\n",
    "- **Handles both numerical and categorical data**: You can use decision trees for a variety of feature types.\n",
    "- **No need for feature scaling**: Unlike many algorithms, decision trees do not require features to be normalized or standardized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ **Cons**:\n",
    "- **Prone to overfitting**: Decision trees can easily overfit to the training data, especially if they grow too deep.\n",
    "- **Can be unstable**: Decision trees can be highly sensitive to small changes in the data, which can lead to very different splits in the tree.\n",
    "- **Not always optimal for high-dimensional data**: With many features, the tree might become unnecessarily complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔄 **Types of Decision Trees**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Trees**: These trees are used for categorical outcomes, where the target variable is discrete.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Predicting whether an email is spam (Yes/No).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regression Trees**: These trees are used for continuous outcomes, where the target variable is numeric.\n",
    "   - **Example**: Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, location, etc.\n",

    "Decision trees are a versatile and intuitive algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. While they are simple and interpretable, they can be prone to overfitting and can be unstable with noisy datasets.
