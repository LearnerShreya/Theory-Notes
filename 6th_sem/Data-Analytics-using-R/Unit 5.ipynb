    "\n",
    "Prescriptive analytics is the most advanced form of analytics, providing actionable recommendations by combining data insights, optimization techniques, and machine learning. It not only predicts future outcomes but also suggests the best course of action to achieve the best possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers the question: \"What should be done next?\" to achieve the desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **2.1. Designed Experiments**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are Designed Experiments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **designed experiment** is a systematic way of testing how one or more variables (called independent variables) affect an outcome (called the dependent variable). It is used to uncover **cause-and-effect relationships** in various fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features:**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ **Controlled Environment:** Minimizes the impact of external factors.  \n",
    "✔ **Randomization:** Ensures unbiased assignment of participants or units.  \n",
    "✔ **Replication:** Repeats the experiment for accuracy.  \n",
    "✔ Helps find optimal solutions in complex environments.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-Life Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Clinical Drug Trials:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A pharmaceutical company tests a new diabetes drug.\n",
    "* They divide participants into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Group A (Treatment Group):** Gets the new drug.\n",
    "  * **Group B (Control Group):** Gets a placebo (fake pill).\n",
    "* After a period, they compare health results between the two groups to see if the drug works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps in Designed Experiments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Problem:** Clearly state what you want to test.\n",
    "2. **Identify Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Independent Variables:** The factors you manipulate (e.g., drug dosage).\n",
    "   * **Dependent Variable:** The outcome you measure (e.g., blood sugar level).\n",
    "3. **Establish Groups:** Create control and treatment groups (randomized).\n",
    "4. **Apply Interventions:** Conduct the experiment and collect data.\n",
    "5. **Analyze Results:** Use statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA, regression).\n",
    "6. **Draw Conclusions:** Interpret results and optimize the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Establishes clear cause-and-effect relationships.  \n",
    "✔ Minimizes the influence of external factors (controlled setting).  \n",
    "✔ Useful in optimizing processes in fields like medicine, manufacturing, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Can be expensive and time-consuming.  \n",
    "❌ Ethical concerns (especially in medical trials).  \n",
    "❌ May require complex statistical analysis.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ **What is Active Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Active Learning** is a type of **machine learning** where the model doesn’t just passively learn from data — it **actively chooses the most useful data to learn from**.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Think of it as a smart student who asks questions instead of reading the whole book.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Why Use Active Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Labeling data is often **expensive and time-consuming** (e.g., medical images).\n",
    "* Active Learning helps you learn effectively with **fewer labeled examples**.\n",
    "* Best when you have **lots of unlabeled data**, but labeling is costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **How Active Learning Works (Step-by-Step)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a **small set of labeled data**.\n",
    "2. Train an initial model using this data.\n",
    "3. Use the model to **make predictions on unlabeled data**.\n",
    "4. Identify which data the model is **most uncertain about**.\n",
    "5. Request labels for these uncertain examples from an **expert (oracle)**.\n",
    "6. Add the new labeled data to the training set.\n",
    "7. Repeat until the model performs well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 **Key Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Labeled Data:** Data with answers (e.g., an image of a cat with the label \"Cat\").\n",
    "* **Unlabeled Data:** Data without answers.\n",
    "* **Oracle:** The expert who provides correct labels (e.g., a doctor).\n",
    "* **Query Strategy:** The method the model uses to choose which data to ask labels for.\n",

    "| **Autonomous Vehicles**  | Request labels for tricky driving scenarios. |\n",

    "\n",
    "* Saves time and labeling costs.\n",
    "* Learns faster by focusing only on important data.\n",
    "* Improves model accuracy with fewer examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ **Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Requires a reliable oracle (expert).\n",
    "* May need a good query strategy for best results.\n",
    "* Can be slow if querying too often.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Simple Example: Learning Fruits**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are teaching a model to recognize fruits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with 5 labeled fruit images (apple, banana, etc.).\n",
    "* The model tries to classify others but is unsure about a peach.\n",
    "* It asks you (the oracle) to label the peach.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What It Means:**\n",
    "In designed experiments, you test one thing at a time and observe the effect it has. The main goal is to plan a controlled test, change one factor, and measure the outcome to see what happens.\n",

    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Testing New Medicines:**\n",
    "  When a pharmaceutical company creates a new medicine, they first test it on a small group of patients to see how effective it is and if there are any side effects. This helps to determine whether it should be approved for widespread use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A/B Testing on Websites:**\n",
    "  Websites often test two versions (A and B) of a page to see which one works better. For example, an e-commerce website may change the color of a \"Buy Now\" button and show version A to half of the visitors and version B to the other half. By comparing how many purchases are made in each case, they can determine which button color is more effective.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Detecting Spam Emails:**\n",
    "  A spam filter might look at emails and identify which ones are likely spam based on patterns. When it’s uncertain (e.g., a new type of spam), the filter may ask for feedback. A user can tell it whether an email is spam or not, helping the filter improve faster by learning from only the most relevant examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training a Chatbot:**\n",
    "  A chatbot learns to improve its answers by asking questions. If it receives an unclear or complex query, it might ask the user to rephrase or clarify their question. By learning from these interactions, the chatbot gets better at responding in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Diagnosing Medical Images:**\n",
    "  A machine learning model used to analyze medical images (like X-rays or MRIs) can be uncertain about certain images. In those cases, it might ask a doctor to label or classify the image. By getting this human feedback, the model improves its ability to diagnose images more accurately in the future.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What It Means:**\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of learning where an agent (like a robot or AI) learns by interacting with its environment. The agent takes actions, receives rewards or punishments based on those actions, and uses the feedback to improve its decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Self-driving Cars:**\n",
    "  A self-driving car learns to navigate by trial and error. When it stops at a red light, it receives a \"reward\" (it stays on track). If it runs a red light, it gets a \"punishment\" (an accident or traffic violation). Over time, the car learns the best actions to take in different traffic scenarios to ensure safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Playing Chess or Video Games:**\n",
    "  An AI that plays chess or a video game learns by playing many games. It receives rewards when it wins and penalties when it loses. With each game, the AI refines its strategies to increase its chances of winning in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training a Robot to Walk:**\n",
    "  A robot learns how to walk by attempting different movements. Every time it takes a step without falling, it receives a reward (it progresses). If it falls, it gets a penalty (it has to start over). Over time, the robot improves its walking skills by learning from these successes and failures.\n",
