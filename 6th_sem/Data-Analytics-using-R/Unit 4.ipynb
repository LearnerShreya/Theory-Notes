    "## **1. Introduction to Survival Analysis**  \n",
    "Survival analysis is a **statistical method** used to analyze the **time until an event occurs**. This event could be **death, failure of a system, recovery from an illness, or churn of a customer in business**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of Survival Analysis:**  \n",
    "✅ Analyzes **time-to-event data**.  \n",
    "✅ Handles **censored data** (when an event hasn’t happened yet for some subjects).  \n",
    "✅ Estimates **survival probabilities** over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Examples:**  \n",
    "- Medical studies: Time until a patient dies after treatment.  \n",
    "- Business: Time until a customer cancels a subscription.  \n",
    "- Engineering: Time until a machine breaks down.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Important Terminologies in Survival Analysis**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Event (Failure or Success)**\n",
    "The occurrence of a **specific event** (e.g., death, machine failure, recovery).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Survival Time (T)**\n",
    "The time from the **start of observation** until the event occurs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Censoring**\n",
    "When the exact event time is **unknown**, we call it **censored data**. Types of censoring:  \n",
    "- **Right-censoring**: The event hasn’t occurred by the end of the study (most common).  \n",
    "- **Left-censoring**: The event happened before observation started.  \n",
    "- **Interval-censoring**: The event happened between two time points but the exact time is unknown.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Example of Right Censoring:**  \n",
    "A patient is part of a cancer drug trial for **5 years**, but they are still alive at the end. We don’t know when they might die, so their data is **right-censored**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Survival Function and Hazard Function**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Survival Function $S(t)$**\n",
    "The probability that the event **has not occurred** by time $t$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S(t) = P(T > t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S(t)$ is always **between 0 and 1**.  \n",
    "- $S(0) = 1$ (At the start, no one has experienced the event).  \n",
    "- $S(\\infty) = 0$ (Eventually, all subjects will experience the event).  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- $S(5) = 0.8$ → 80% of individuals **survive beyond 5 years**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Hazard Function $h(t)$**\n",
    "The **instantaneous rate** at which events occur, given that the subject **has survived up to time t**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- $f(t)$ = Probability density function of survival times.  \n",
    "- $S(t)$ = Survival function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- A **higher hazard** means a higher risk of the event occurring at time $t$.  \n",
    "- Example: If $h(5) = 0.2$, the risk of dying at year 5 is **20%**.  \n",

    "A **non-parametric** method to estimate the survival function.  \n",
    "\n",

    "S(t) = \\prod_{t_i \\leq t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "- $d_i$ = Number of events at time $t_i$.  \n",
    "- $n_i$ = Number of subjects at risk just before $t_i$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **How it Works:**  \n",
    "- At each event time, the survival probability is **multiplied** by the probability of surviving past that time.  \n",
    "- The result is a **stepwise decreasing survival curve**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Used for:** Comparing two groups (e.g., treatment vs. control).  \n",
    "✅ **Plot:** The **Kaplan-Meier curve** shows survival probabilities over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Log-Rank Test**\n",
    "A **hypothesis test** to compare **two or more survival curves** (e.g., comparing drug A vs. drug B).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): No difference in survival between groups.  \n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): A significant difference exists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the **p-value < 0.05**, we reject $H_0$ and conclude that there is a **difference in survival** between groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Cox Proportional Hazards Model (Cox Regression)**\n",
    "A **semi-parametric** model that estimates the effect of variables on survival time.  \n",

    "- $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ = Independent variables.  \n",
    "- $b_1, b_2, ..., b_n$ = Regression coefficients.  \n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Interpretation:**  \n",
    "- If $b_1 > 0$, the variable **increases the hazard (risk of event)**.  \n",
    "- If $b_1 < 0$, the variable **decreases the hazard** (protective factor).  \n",
    "- If $HR = e^{b_1} = 2$, the event is **twice as likely** for that variable.  \n",
